### Journal Entry: Software Security Enhancement Project at Global Rain  

### Project Overview  
As a developer at Global Rain, I worked with our client, Artemis Financial, a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their customers. The financial plans include savings, retirement, investments, and insurance.  

I was able to conduct a vulnerability assessment of Artemis Financials’ current software. I identified several areas where security could be enhanced, particularly in data encryption and secure communications. 

Two main learnings that I took from this were the use of the Vulnerability Assessment Process Flow Diagram in creating a checklist of areas to be cognizant of and to address during the solutioning process. Followed up with an overall assessment once the project was completed.  And the other learning was the need to ensure that the new security measures did not impede the application's functionality, the user experience, or the application security.  The most challenging aspect was in getting the application server environment configured to support the enhanced security model of the application.

To increase security layers, I implemented robust encryption protocols for data in transit and at rest. For future projects, I plan to use a combination of automated security scanning tools and manual code reviews to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities effectively.

After implementing the new features, I conducted testing to ensure both functionality and security. This included static and functional testing along with vulnerability scanning. Post-refactoring, I re-evaluated the code to check for any new vulnerabilities introduced inadvertently.

Throughout this project, I utilized several tools, including encryption libraries and security frameworks, Java keytool, and Maven OWASP dependency checking.

There is some value even from this fairly limited exercise to demonstrate some basic, but key capabilities.  In an actual project, the overall security framework would be architected to encompass the business and technical ecosystems, but it would still be down to the developer to be able to implement the pattern and the developer trusted to provided safe, and efficient code.  Having this in one’s portfolio would enhance any future employment conversation.
